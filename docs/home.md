> Create a discord server your way

QuaBot is the bot you need in your server. Our many commands allow you to create the perfect server for you. We have everything you could ask for from a bot, with even more on the way.

This wiki is used to display commands and how they can be used. If you want to help extending this wiki, please join [our discord server](https://quabot.net/redirects/discord.html).
