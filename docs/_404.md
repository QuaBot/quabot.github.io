Yes i did just google random quotes and copied the first one i saw. Just to give this page some spice and you something to laugh about. Now laugh, i've spent way too much time on the 404 page already. Who's gonna see this even? Well, make a choice to go somewhere, and quick, cuz i should be moving on to the next part.
