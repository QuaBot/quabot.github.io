QuaBot has an Suggestions and Reports system, easily configurable with major updates coming in the future.

### Suggestions
#### How does it work?
Users run the `/suggest` command and leave a suggestion. Users can vote in the suggestions channel to decide the outcome. When it's time or a desicion has been made, use `/end-suggestion` to stop the voting.
#### Setup
They are enabled by default, if you want to disable the module use `/config` and go to Toggle Features -> Suggestions -> Disable. If you want to keep them on, keep reading. Use `/config` and go to Change Channels. Select Suggestions and mention the channels where you want new suggestions to be sent. They are also logged to the log channel. That's it! They are working now.

### Reports
#### How does it work?
Users run the `/report` command and report something, this was changed to text reports instead of user reports recently, since this is more usefull. There is a channel for reports, where staff can take a note and maybe followup with a punishment.
#### Setup
They are enabled by default, if you want to disable the module use `/config` and go to Toggle Features -> Reports -> Disable. If you want to keep them on, keep reading. Use `/config` and go to Change Channels. Select Reports and mention the channels where you want new reports to be sent, and you're done!

> [!ATTENTION]
> We have disabled the polls feature since it was not working and was not up to our standards, it will be re-released later.
