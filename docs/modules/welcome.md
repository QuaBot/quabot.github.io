Setup welcome messages and join roles.

### How does it work?
Go to `/config` -> Configure Channels -> Welcome Channel -> Mention the channel. Welcome messages are now enabled. Disable them in the Toggle Features tab of `/config`. Join roles are enabled by default, toggle them in the Toggle Features tab of `/config`. Configure the roles in the Configure Roles tab of `/config`.

### Join messages
Go to `/config` -> Other -> Welcome Messages -> Send the new message. It will then be sent next time someone joins the server! (Same goes for leave messages)
