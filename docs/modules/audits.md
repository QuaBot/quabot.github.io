Log deleted messages, role updates and all sorts of other events.

### How does it work?
You setup a log channel, `/config` -> Configure Channels -> Log Channel -> mention the channel. Whenever an event happens, message gets deleted, user get banned, messages get cleared it will be saved to this channel to be recalled at a later time. We even log what attachments were on deleted messages so you can check them later!

### Enable or disable events
You can now toggle certain events from logging, by default all are enabled, apart from Voice channel leave, join and move. You can enable/disable events logging with `/config` -> Logging Settings -> Event you want to toggle -> click the buttons. It's very easy and handy.
